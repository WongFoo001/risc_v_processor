# DINO CPU

The DINO (Davis IN Order) CPU is a simple RISC-V CPU for use in the [ECS 154B Computer Architecture class](https://github.com/jlpteaching/ECS154B) as University of California, Davis.

The DINO CPU is currently in an early Beta.
We are using it in the Winter 2019 offering of 154B and we forsee making significant updates for future quarters.
